# sql-datawarehouse-practice
Practice building a data warehouse using SQL Server including ETL, data modeling, and analytics.

Welcome to my data warehouse practice project. I'm building this based on the tutorial project video by [Data with Baraa](www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GVqKuTVANE).
This project will demonstrate building a data warehouse and include analytics.

#### Specifications
- **Data Sources**: Data will be imported from two CSV files (CRP and ERM) provided by the tutorial.
- **Data Quality**: Data will be cleansed and any issues resolved before analysis.
- **Integration**: Both data sources will be combined into a single data model.
- **Scope**: Focus will be on the latest data set as historization is not required.
- **Documentation**: Clear documentation will be provided to support stakeholders and analytics teams.

## About Me

I'm Teri, and I'm an aspiring data analyst. I'm very interested in learning all facets of data, not just the analytics part.
